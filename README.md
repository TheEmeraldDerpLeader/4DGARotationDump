# 4DGARotationDump
Place to dump my Lua (Codea) program for a Geometric Algebra implementation of 4D rotations

Notable resources I used:
- https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/
- http://www.faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/laga/
- https://core.ac.uk/reader/148622160 specifically page 8, everything else doesn't matter (also k1 formula is wrong :P)

Who needs Perwass's book to decompose rotations into lines, amirite
